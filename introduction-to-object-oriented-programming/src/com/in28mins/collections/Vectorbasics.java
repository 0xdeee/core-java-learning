/**
 * @author dstar - Vector is a type of List collections which is built over
 *         Arrays. we developed the need for Vectors cuz in Arrays we can't
 *         dynamically add values If we need to add new value in an array we
 *         should create a new array and fetch the old elements & add the new
 *         element But Vector is not some magic that can add elements
 *         dynamically, It is Built over Array... Instead of you having to
 *         create a new Array and fetch the old elements and insert the new
 *         elements etc... all these work is done implicitly by Vector
 *         Collection but in the core Vector is just a Array
 * 
 *         Vector is there in Java since the first version... it is also
 *         Synchronized, so we can use Vectors in operations where we need
 *         thread safety.
