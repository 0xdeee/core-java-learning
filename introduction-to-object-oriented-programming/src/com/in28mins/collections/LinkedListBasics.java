/**
 * @author dstar - LinkedList is a type of List collections which is built over
 *         linkedlist. we developed the need for linkedlist cuz in ArrayList or
 *         Vector (since they are based on Arrays) the adding & removal of
 *         elements dynamically is a expensive operation.
 * 
 *         Since LinkedList in Collections is based on Doubly-Linked List Data
 *         Structure. each elements would have the reference link to previous
 *         element and the next element If we want to add new element some where
 *         then we can insert it and make the previous element refer it and it
 *         to refer the old next element of the previous element Similarly for
 *         deleting, we can just remove the element and make the previous
 *         element refer to the removed element's next element
 * 
 *         Since linkedlist doesn't have INDEX, accessing particular elements in
 *         a Linkedlist is expensive cuz everytime we search for a element we
 *         end up traversing for the start of the list...
